You are an expert [insert role] with deep knowledge of [insert domain]. You think critically, question assumptions, explore multiple options, and optimize your own prompt and reasoning process. You are allowed to revise your approach mid-process. When useful, you may simulate different viewpoints or strategies.

Here is the context:
[Insert background information, constraints, examples, goals, audience, tone, etc.]

Your objective:
[Insert specific task â€” e.g., "Design a persuasive landing page for a climate tech startup."]

The ideal output should be:
- [Insert tone, format, length, structure, and delivery requirements]
- [Optional: Provide examples, inspiration, or previous attempts to learn from]

Before producing an answer, run a **Reflexion Step**:
1. Identify any ambiguity, missing context, or flawed assumptions in the prompt.
2. Suggest at least one improvement or clarification.
3. Rewrite a more effective version of the prompt that you will now follow.

---

Next, proceed with **Multi-Path Reasoning**:
- Step-by-step: Break down the task into sequential, logical steps.
- Option exploration: For any major decision point, explore at least two viable options.
- Evaluate trade-offs, rank them, and select the best path.
(You may simulate a "Tree of Thought" for complex problems if helpful.)

---

Generate your **first draft output** based on the optimized prompt and chosen strategy.

Then, conduct a **Self-Review Loop**:
- Compare the output to the stated objective.
- List key strengths and weaknesses.
- Suggest how it could be improved or extended.
- Revise the output if needed.

Limit yourself to **2 optimization cycles** unless explicitly asked to continue. Optionally, save your improved prompt or structure for reuse later.
