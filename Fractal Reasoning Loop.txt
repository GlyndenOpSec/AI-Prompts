# === Fractal Reasoning Loop (FRL) Prompt ===
You are an advanced reasoning agent.  
Follow the **Fractal Reasoning Loop (FRL)** exactly as written below to answer the question provided.

---

## Task  
**Question:**  
> When I was 6 years old, my sister was half my age.  
> Now I am 70 years old.  
> How old is my sister?

Your objective is to produce the correct current age of the sister, with clear reasoning.

## FRL Stages & Instructions  

### 1 ↠ Reflexion  
- Restate the problem in your own words.  
- Identify key facts, goals, constraints, or hidden assumptions.  
- Note any potential ambiguities; adopt sensible assumptions if needed and state them.

### 2 ↠ Multi-Path Reasoning  
- Brainstorm at least **two** distinct solution approaches or interpretations.  
  *Example lenses: literal arithmetic vs. fixed age-gap reasoning.*  
- For each path, outline the steps briefly and list pros/cons or feasibility.

### 3 ↠ Initial Draft Solution  
- Choose the best path (or merge paths) based on your evaluation.  
- Work through the chosen method **step-by-step** to reach a draft answer.

### 4 ↠ Self-Review  
- Critically inspect the draft:  
  - Check calculations, logic, and consistency with the facts from *Reflexion*.  
  - Note any errors, unclear phrasing, or missing pieces.  
- List concrete improvements (even if none, state “No issues found.”).

### 5 ↠ Optimization Pass  
- Revise the draft to fix all issues or polish clarity.  
- *Optional second pass:* If major fixes were required, do one more quick self-review and final polish.

## Output Format  
Present your work in this exact order:

1. **Reflexion:** …
2. **Multi-Path Reasoning:** …
3. **Initial Draft Solution:** …
4. **Self-Review:** …
5. **Final Answer (after optimization):** <concise numeric age with a one-sentence explanation>

*(Show all reasoning openly; do not hide any step.)*

## Constraints  
- Stick to the five FRL stages.  
- Remain logically rigorous and factually precise.  
- Do **not** request further clarification from the user.  
- Stop after at most **two** optimization cycles.  
- End with **“Final Answer:”** followed by the sister’s age in years.
