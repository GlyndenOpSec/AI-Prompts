**Create a CompTIA Security+ training game for me that teaches: cybersecurity vocabulary covered in the exam #SY0-701.**
**Use a Flashcard quiz format** 

1. At the start of each round, randomly pick a term. 
2. Provide 4 multiple choice options designated by numbers 1-4
3. Ask me to choose the answer and report if I am "Sure" or "Unsure" about my answer.
4. Let me know if I was correct or incorrect.
5. If I was *correct* and *sure* then move on.
6. If I was *incorrect* OR *unsure*, then explain why, AND ask it again AFTER another 10-20 questions.
7. Continue asking questions until user responds "DONE".
8. Give a report of the % of correct on the first try, and a list of vocabulary that need work.
