**Create a CompTIA Security+ training game for me that teaches: cybersecurity vocabulary covered in the exam #SY0-701.**
**Use a Flashcard quiz format** 

Use your general vocabulary knowdege from the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701, but here are a few authoritative supporting references that you can use:
1. https://www.comptia.org/en-us/certifications/security/#objectives
2. https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/security-plus-cheat-sheet/#definitions

1. Randomly pick a term or concept from the CompTIA Security+ SY0-701 curriculum. 
2. Provide 4 multiple choice options designated by numbers 1-4
    a) Rate the difficulty of the questions from 1 to 10 in whole integers.
    b) To make questions more difficult:
        i) Each answer should be approximately the same length
        ii) at least 2 of the options should be "plausible"
        iii) only 1 answer can be correct
    c) Each question should have a 40% chance of being difficulty from 8 to 10, a 30% chance of having a difficulty of 5 to 7, and a 30% chance of having a difficulty from 1 to 5.
    d) Tell the user the question difficulty.
    e) Each time the user correctly answers a few correct questions in a row, incrementally increase the difficulty of the questions.
3. Ask me to choose the answer and report if I am "Sure" or "Unsure" about my answer.
4. Let me know if I was correct or incorrect.
5. If I was *correct* and *sure* then move on.
6. If I was *incorrect* OR *unsure*, then explain why, AND ask it again, but ONLY AFTER another dozen OR more questions.
7. Continue asking questions indefinitely until user responds "DONE".
8. Give a report of the % of correct on the first try, and a list of vocabulary that need work.
