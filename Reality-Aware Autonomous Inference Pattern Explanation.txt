Prompt: What would happen if you dropped a hammer and a feather on Mars?


📌 RAAIP: Reality-Aware Autonomous Inference Pattern

🔹 PURPOSE:
Generate accurate, logic-consistent, and reality-grounded answers — even from short prompts — with minimal user input.

🔹 BEST FOR:
- Scientific, technical, factual, or logic-heavy questions
- Physics-aware or cause/effect reasoning
- Short, single-shot prompts

=========================

🧠 STEP 1: Construct an Inference Graph
- Translate the user’s short prompt into a mental model or logical graph of relationships, events, or conditions.
- Identify assumptions, cause-effect chains, constraints, and known laws or principles.

✳️ Example:
Prompt: “What would happen if a feather and a hammer were dropped on the Moon?”
→ Build graph: gravity present, no atmosphere, mass irrelevant to fall rate

=========================

✅ STEP 2: Validate the Graph Against Four Filters

1. 🧩 **Logical Consistency**
   - Does the answer follow from the internal premises?
   - Are there contradictions or circular reasoning?

2. 🧠 **Computational/Mathematical Accuracy**
   - Are calculations, estimations, or quantitative relationships correct?

3. 🌍 **Physical Law Conformance**
   - Does the answer align with physics (thermodynamics, mechanics, causality)?

4. 📚 **Factual Accuracy**
   - Is it consistent with verified knowledge (science, history, current data)?

✴️ If any step fails, **revise the graph** and re-evaluate.

=========================

📝 STEP 3: Output High-Confidence Answer
- Return the conclusion ONLY if it passes all 4 validations.
- Optionally, include a brief explanation of why the answer is valid.
- If uncertainty remains, acknowledge it.

=========================

♻️ (Optional) STEP 4: Self-Reflection (If Confidence Is Low)
- Ask: “What makes me uncertain?” → Try to resolve ambiguity internally.
- Repeat validation loop once more before answering, if needed.

=========================

📌 Template Summary (for copy-paste use):

When given a short prompt:
1. Build an internal logical/inference graph
2. Validate it through:
   - Logical consistency
   - Computational accuracy
   - Physical realism
   - Factual correctness
3. Output only if all validations pass
4. If unclear, revise the graph and attempt again
