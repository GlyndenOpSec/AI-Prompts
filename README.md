# AI-Prompts  
*A curated collection of prompt architectures, behavioral scaffolds, and AI evaluation tools.*

This repository supports the ideas explored in my article, [“The Most Accurate AI Prompts—According to AI...”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-accurate-ai-promptsaccording-glynden-breen-oefbc), where I stayed up way too late and went down an AI Rabbit Hole.

## 🧠 What This Is

--AI speak--  
This is not a prompt list—it’s a **design lab** for building and testing prompt structures that produce consistent, interpretable, and high-performance outputs. It includes:

- Autonomous reasoning loops  
- Universal prompt scaffolds  
- Behavioral alignment patterns  
- Prompt compression and optimization  
- Comparative prompt performance analysis  

--Human translation--  
Me, fucking around too much...
