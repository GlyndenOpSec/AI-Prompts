# AI-Prompts  
*A curated collection of prompt architectures, behavioral scaffolds, and AI evaluation tools.*

This repository supports the ideas explored in my article, [“The Most Accurate AI Prompts—According to AI...”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-accurate-ai-promptsaccording-glynden-breen-oefbc), where I examine how prompt design influences the behavior, reliability, and interpretability of large language models. These files represent my ongoing work in **prompt engineering, AI alignment, and behavioral control**.

## 🧠 What This Is

This is not a prompt list—it’s a **design lab** for building and testing prompt structures that produce consistent, interpretable, and high-performance outputs. It includes:

- **Autonomous reasoning loops**  
- **Universal prompt scaffolds**  
- **Behavioral alignment patterns**  
- **Prompt compression and optimization**  
- **Comparative prompt performance analysis**

## 📂 File Descriptions

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Autonomous Mega-Prompt Loop.txt` | A recursive prompt structure for autonomous task execution and self-refinement. |
| `Shortened AMPL.txt` | A compressed version of the AMPL for tighter token budgets and faster iteration. |
| `Fractal Reasoning Loop.txt` & `Fractal Reasoning Loop (FRL).pdf` | A modular reasoning pattern designed for recursive evaluation and layered inference. |
| `Reality-Aware Autonomous Inference Pattern.txt` | A scaffold that encourages grounded, verifiable reasoning in autonomous agents. |
| `Gamify Prompt Training Prompt.txt` | A meta-prompt that turns prompt refinement into a game-like feedback loop. |
| `Universal Expert AI Prompt.txt` | A general-purpose system prompt for expert-level performance across technical, creative, and advisory domains. |
| `Ultimate Universal AI Prompt.txt` & `.pdf` | A comprehensive, domain-agnostic prompt designed to maximize clarity, structure, and behavioral consistency. |
| `The Ultimate Universal AI Prompt for Any Domain.pdf` | A formatted version of the above, suitable for presentation or reference. |
| `Comparison Report.pdf` | A side-by-side evaluation of prompt variants, measuring behavioral consistency, tone control, and task performance. |
