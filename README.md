# AI-Prompts  
*A curated collection of prompt architectures, behavioral scaffolds, and AI evaluation tools.*

This repository supports the ideas explored in my article, [“The Most Accurate AI Prompts—According to AI...”](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/most-accurate-ai-promptsaccording-glynden-breen-oefbc), where I examine how prompt design influences the behavior, reliability, and interpretability of large language models. These files represent my ongoing work in **prompt engineering**, **AI alignment**, and **behavioral control**.

## 🧠 What This Is

This is not a prompt list—it’s a **design lab** for building and testing prompt structures that produce consistent, interpretable, and high-performance outputs. It includes:

- Autonomous reasoning loops  
- Universal prompt scaffolds  
- Behavioral alignment patterns  
- Prompt compression and optimization  
- Comparative prompt performance analysis
