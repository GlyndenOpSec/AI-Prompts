# AI-Prompts

Welcome to **AI-Prompts**, a curated collection of prompt engineering experiments, security explorations, and system prompt analyses assembled by [Glynden Breen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/glyndenbreen). This repository reflects a deep curiosity about how large language models behave, how prompt design influences output, and how prompts can be hardened—or exploited—for different use cases.
